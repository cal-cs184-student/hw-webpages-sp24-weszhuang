      <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This project takes us through the whole rendering process of an object. We first fire rays off the camera, write
        helper methods
        for shape intersections, and calculate the irradiance of each surface point. There are a few ways we can do
        this.
        We used hemipshere sampling, select sampling (only sampling from light source), and we also used recursion with
        a russian roulette style
        base case to simualte multiple bounces of light.

      <h3>
        Walk through the ray generation and primitive intersection parts of the rendering pipeline.
      </h3>
      <p>
        A ray comes with a point and a direction. In order to generate a ray, we had to first convert image coordinates
        to camera coordinates. Image coordinates are normalized so that the bottom-left corner is (0,0) and top right
        corner is (1,1)
        In the world, the center is (0,0,-1), bottom-left is (-tan(radians(hFov)*.5), -tan(radians(hFov)*.5), -1) and
        top right is (tan(radians(hFov)*.5), tan(radians(hFov)*.5), -1).
        We first shift the image so that the center is at (0,0) not (0.5, 0.5). We then shift the image by the total
        width and height of the camera space. <br><br>
        double width = 2*tan(radians(hFov)*.5); <br>
        double height = 2*tan(radians(vFov)*.5); <br>
        Vector3D camerapoint = Vector3D((x-0.5)*width, (y-0.5)*height, (double)-1.0); <br>
        Vector3D worldpoint = c2w*camerapoint; <br>
        worldpoint.normalize(); <br><br>
        Finally, in order to transform the ray from camera space to world space, we multiply c2w and normalize.<br>
        Vector3D worldpoint = c2w*camerapoint;<br><br>
        Rays are generated in the raytrace_pixel function. The function sends ns_aa rays that at random locations pass
        through the pixel.<br><br>
        In order to check if these rays collide with objects, I have implemented triangle intersection and sphere
        intersection. <br>
        For the triangle intersection (I will give more detail in the next answer) I used the Moller Trumbore algorithm.
        I defined E1, E2, S, S1, S2, and used the equation 1/(S1*E1)*[S2*E2, S1 * S, S2 * D] to solve for t, b1, and b2.
        Now that we have the
        barycentric coordinates, we can check if any of these barycentric coordinates are negative and if t is beyond or
        before the ray's min and max values.
        If not, we have found when the ray hits the triangle. <br><br>
        A sphere is defined as (p-c)^2 - R^2 = 0. We can plug in the ray equation to p and solve for t, which gives us a
        quadratic equation. <br><br>
        A = d*d <br>
        B = 2(o-c)*d<br>
        C = (o-c)*(o-c)-R^2 <br><br>
        To test if an intersection happens, we simply check if the descriminatnt is greater or equal to zero. There can
        be one or two intersections.
        We solve for t1 and t2 through the quadratic formula and we make sure that the intersection times are within ray
        limits.

      </p>
      <br>

      <h3>
        Explain the triangle intersection algorithm you implemented in your own words.
      </h3>
      <p>
        A triangle can be defined by its barycentric coordinates: P = (1-b1-b2)P0 + b1P1 + b2P2. we substitute the ray
        equation for P and
        put the equation in the form of Mx = b. Then by using cramers rule, we can derive the Moller Trumbore algorithm.
        Through the muller trumbore algorithm,
        we can solve for t, b1, and b2. We can check if an intersection is valid by checking if b1, b2, and (1-b1-b2)
        are all positive and sum to one and
        check if t is non negative.

        Walk through your BVH construction algorithm. Explain the heuristic you chose for picking the splitting point.
      </h3>
      <p>
        My BVH construction algorithm builds a bvh tree recursively. If the number of primitives is less than
        max_leaf_size, we return the node.
        If not, we choose our split axis. Our split axis is chosen to be the axis with the biggest extent (so we can
        chop it up further).
        Our heuristic for the splitting point is by calculating the average centroid. Then all the centroids left of the
        average centroid go in the left subtree.
        Others go in the right subtree. There are edge cases where our splitting heuristic will put all primitives in
        left/right trees.
        In this case, we add the last element of the primitive to the empty subtree.

      <p>
        The original cow scene took 34 seconds to render without BVH with 5856 intersections/ray. <br>
        With the BVH optimization, it only takes 0.12 seconds with an average of ~0.1 intersections/ray. <br><br>
        The original bench scene took 461 seconds to render without BVH with 67808 intersections/ray. <br>
        With the BVH optimization, it only takes 0.17 seconds with an average of ~0.1 intersections/ray. <br><br>

        This speed is possible since we have sped up the algorithm which is quadratic in runtime to roughly
        linear-logrithmic.
        By having a bounding box, we don't have to try and intersect a ray with all the primitive shapes. If object only
        takes up a small
        part of the scene, most rays will not even hit the first bounding box, saving us precious runtime. Also, when
        checking for bounding box intersections,
        we can only check the x, y, and z plane intersection times, and find the intersection between these values. This
        is less runtime intesntive than trying to
        intersect 6 planes that make up a cube.

      <h3>
        Walk through both implementations of the direct lighting function.
      </h3>
      <p>
        For the hemisphere direct lighting, the samples are randomly taken from a hemisphere around the point we are
        calculating
        the direct lighting for. These are then checked to see if their first intersection is with a light source. If
        they do
        intersect with a light source then the light contribution is added to a total which is then averaged across the
        number
        of samples taken.

        For the importance direct lighting, we iterate through the lights in our scene. Regardless of light if a sample
        intersects with another object before the target sample we attribute a contribution of 0 for that sample.For
        each delta
        light we only sample the light a singular time and add the processed result to the final L_out directly. For non
        delta
        lights we take ns_area_light samples of the light which we process and average over all the samples. The final
        result is
        the sum of the contributions of each light in the scene.

        The noise level in the soft shadow under the bunny is significantly improved as the number of light ray sample
        increases. This is due to a better approximation of the light level due to more chances to hit the light.

      <p>
        For the same number of direct lighting samples the lighting sampling far outperforms the hemisphere sampling.
        Not only
        does the lighting sampling provide lower noise for the same samples, but also supports point lights which are
        otherwise
        effectively never sampled by the hemisphere sampling. Also even though the dragon scene has area lights, their
        small
        size causes them to effectively not ever get hit as well.

        If the maximum ray depth is reached we return no light. Then we select the roulette probability cpdf to either
        be 1.0 or 0.3 depending on if this is the top level recursive call or not. This allows us to satisfy the
        requirement that if indirect illumination is turned on it will always trace atleast one indirect bounce. Then
        depending on if its accumulating bounces, is the direct lighting only case, or is cutting off due to roulette we
        add the direct lighting to the output. When the depth is still allowing indirect bounces we recursively call our
        indirect lighting function and add the result scaled with the appropriate values to our result.

        Both images do not include the 0 bounce illumination(the light). The direct illumination image only shows how it
        looks when accounting for single bounce illumination and therefore does not light the ceiling or produce any
        sort of colored lighting on the sphers resultant from the walls. The indirect illumination includes these
        effects of global illumination such as the reflected colored light, as well as the reflected lighting of the
        ceiling. It however does not contain the bright direct lighting contributed by the light source on the
        environment therefore missing highlights and brightness.

        At the second bounce of light we see the bunny, ceiling, and other parts get lit by the first indirect lighting
        bounce.
        This allows the lighting of things which are not directly illuminated, and allows the objects in the scene to
        take on
        colors based on their environment not just the direct lighting. The 3rd bounce contributes to this effect
        similarly for
        light contributions with 2 indirect bounces. This improves the accuracy of the global illumination further but
        contributes far less than the first indirect bounce.

        We see the totaled effect of contribution from each of the bounce depth layers as discussed in the previous
        question.
        The differences between 0, 1, and 2 bounces is very stark whereas from 3 onwards the contribution it provides is
        a far
        more gradual improvement on the image quality.

        Explain adaptive sampling. Walk through your implementation of the adaptive sampling.
      </h3>
      <p>
        The goal of adaptive sampling is to stop sampling pixels for which the continued change to a pixel falls within
        some tolerance range with an acceptable confidence. In the case of the project, the confidence level is that of
        95%.

        It is implemented by keeping running totals of the sum of illuminance and squared illuminance respectively.
        These are used to then calculate the std deviation and mean which are used in the inequality we have to check if
        the illuminance of that pixel has converged to the extent of our liking. These checks are only performed every
        set batch size number of samples for the efficiency of computation.
      </p>
